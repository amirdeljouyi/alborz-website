## 5. Two-Factor Authentication
**Requirements**:
- NetID
- Working Phone Number

**Instructions**:
- In addition to the regular “SMS code” method for logging into university webpages and resources, you can choose to use this method.
- It is a safer way of logging in by using the login keys generated by an Authenticator app on your phone.
- In order to use this method, you need to already have your phone number registered in the university’s [Identity Manager webpage](https://iam.tudelft.nl/). 
- You must also install an Authenticator app of your choice. Preferably use the [Microsoft Authenticator App](https://www.microsoft.com/nl-nl/security/mobile-authenticator-app).

- Follow the step-by-step guide provided on the website to set up the Two-Step Authentication method on your mobile phone.
- In case you lose, change, or reset your phone, you may lose the Authenticator app and access to your login keys. In that case, you need to reach out to the ICT services of your faculty to reset your login method back to “SMS code.” This can also be done by submitting a “ICT malfunction or request ICT service” in the [TopDesk website](https://www.topdesk.com). Afterwards, follow the instructions provided again to re-establish the Two-Step Authentication method.
