**Instructions**:
- Options: [Odido](https://www.odido.nl/), KPN, etc.
- It takes 5 minutes in person or 1-2 days via ordering online.

- If you already have a pre-paid SIM card, you can transfer the number to your new SIM card.

- Select one of the options that best suits your travel needs.

## 12. Register Healthcare Provider
**Requirements**:
- BSN
- Address
- DigiD

**Instructions**:
- Everyone needs to find and register with a General Practitioner (or GP) to use healthcare services in the Netherlands properly.
- The GP is the first point of contact when health issues arise. Moreover, the insurance might sometimes only cover your costs if you have consulted a GP before taking action regarding your health problems.
- You can find the GPs in your area by searching “GP” in Google Maps. Registration can be done via email or phone call, or by filling out the registration form on the website of each GP.
- It might take a couple of weeks to complete your registration with the GP. Usually, calling them can expedite the process.
- The GPs usually limit their services to the houses in their vicinity or residencies with specific zip codes. So first check the area the GP covers before registering with them.  
- After registering with a particular GP, they will make an account for you on the [MyHealth website](https://mijngezondheid.net) or any other website they use. The websites are used for appointments with GPs, ordering medicine, etc. Ensure you are given access to the websites by logging into them. Call the GP again if your account has not been created on the website or if you have access problems.
