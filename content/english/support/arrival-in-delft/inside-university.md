## 1. Housing
**Instructions**:
- Start looking for a place to live in NL as soon as you receive and sign the contract and know you are coming to NL. This is very important because housing is very limited in NL.
- The university has a service called [DUWO](https://duwo.nl) providing newcomers with affordable short-term (six months to a year) housing on campus.
- The secretary of your department section makes the request.
- Apply as soon as your start date is set because the spaces are limited.
- There is a non-refundable registration fee of approximately €225. 
- Between two to six weeks before the start of your contract, DUWO will send you the link to the houses that are available. There is a limited time to select a property because the number of candidates accessing the website is higher than the availability.
- People living outside the EU and without the means to pay the registration fees and advanced payments can refer to the secretary of their section/department to look for solutions.
- The registration fee will be refunded if DUWO does not find a space for you. It will not if you choose not to rent a place with DUWO.
- Because DUWO is not guaranteed, parallel to requesting a place with them, look at the websites below:
