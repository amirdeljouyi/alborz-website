The story of D.I.S.A. "Alborz" begins with its origins in the Iranian Student Society of TU Delft (ISSTUD), an organization founded in 2009 by Iranian students seeking to create a community for cultural exchange, academic support, and social interaction. Over the years, ISSTUD served as a platform for Iranian students at TU Delft to connect, celebrate their heritage, and engage with the broader student body.

In 2022, the world witnessed the rise of the "Women, Life, Freedom" movement, which inspired a group of Iranian students to reflect on the role and impact of their association. Feeling the need for a stronger, more transparent organization, this group took the initiative to become the latest board of ISSTUD. They realized that significant changes were essential to build an association that not only served its members but also stood for integrity and clarity in its operations.

As a result, the decision was made to rebrand ISSTUD and establish a new foundation for the association, one built on principles of inclusivity, transparency. With this vision, D.I.S.A. "Alborz" was born and officially registered in the Netherlands under the KvK number 89122763 in 2023. The rebranding process ensured that the new association was equipped with clear statutes, by-laws, and policies, setting a solid structure for future growth and community engagement.

Today, D.I.S.A. "Alborz" honors its heritage while embracing a broader mission, striving to create a space where Iranians and friends of Iran can come together to celebrate culture, advocate for freedom, and support one another in pursuit of shared goals.
